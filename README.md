[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/318809e3-f9af-4a74-b4da-0eb61adf325e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/beerd/deploys)

Create collection+indexes and then import schema and shit with bootstrap db for dev..


DEVELOPING NOTES
    Create netlify site
    Enable branch deploys in netlify
    Enable Functions in netlify
    Enable Identity in netlify
    Install `netlify-cli` globally
    Install `fauna-shell` globally
    Run `netlify link` to link the site
    Run `netlify addons:create fauna`
    Run `netlify addons:auth fauna` to auth and create prod database and store secret keys
    Create a new database in faunadb for dev purposes and add a key
    Add a new environment variable in netlify called `FAUNADB_SERVER_SECRET_development` with the key to a dev database
    Go to faunadb and import the schema
    Run `fauna eval --secret=<your db secret key> --file=./bootstrap/bootstrap-db.fql` to create collection and indexes
    Run `npm run build:bootstrap` to build bootstrap scripts
    Run `npm run bootstrap:db` to create dummy data in dev database (need to terminate manually)
    Run `netlify dev` to start vue dev server and netlify proxies for functions with watch etc
    TODO: Zapier...untappd...ratebeer..manual beer sync...

    Run `npm run build` to build production files to `./dist`

    To access environment-specific variables in process.env import `import 'bootstrap/bootstrap-env';` first which will map variables to the current environment via XXX_development pattern
    During pre-build a `.env` file for local env vars will be generated with NODE_ENV=development for `netlify dev` to work in development mode, this file is gitignored
    The database connection is made implicit via the `FAUNADB_SERVER_SECRET` environment variable (stored privately on netlify and on the database on fauna)
    The files in the bootstrap folder are compiled with a typescript binary that may be newer than the one bundled in vue and netlify which may need different syntax

    Master deploys to production environment in production mode
    Develop deploys to branch environment in development mode
    Feature branches deploy to branch environment in development mode
    Pull requests into master deploy to deploy-preview in production mode

ENV VARIABLES
    FAUNADB_SERVER_SECRET
