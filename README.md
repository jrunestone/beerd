An app to review my checked in beers on untappd
Purpose to find old beers to drink again based on mood and rating

Feature: easy to switch between predefined styles (ipa, dipa, dstout, pstout) (predefined filters)
Feature: easy to hit "just drank it again" - no score etc just one more time and possibly "would drink again yes/no"
Feature: custom score (rating + times drunk) + price?
Feature: stats (preferred style, how many litres, money spent etc)
Feature: integrate with systembolaget to see if this particular beer is available right now and where (predefined + search + closest)
